# Data Structure And Algorithms
DataStructure and algorithms implementation using Python

Topics that every programmer should understand as follows

The Code and details will be added in comming days.

**1. Basic Data Structures**

• arrays, loops and invariants
• lists, stacks, queues, sets and recursion
• primitive operators
• uses and algorithms

**2. Complexity**

• space v. time
• average case v. worst case
• Big Oh notation
• computation – exact and approximate

**3. Trees –general, binary and quad trees**

• inductive definitions
• primitive operators
• uses and algorithms

**4. Binary Search Trees**

• searching in general
• definition of binary search trees
• building, modifying and searching
• tree rotations – why, what, how?

**5. Heap trees and Priority queues**

• definition of heaps and priority queues
• binary heap trees – insertions, deletions, building
• bubbling up and bubbling down
• Binomial trees and heaps

**6. Sorting**

• general definitions and theoretical limits
• O(n2) algorithms – bubble, selection, insertion
• tree based algorithms – Treesort and Heapsort
• divide and conquer algorithms – Quicksort and Mergesort
• non-comparison algorithms – Radix sort
• comparisons – average/worst speed, stability, only first m << n, …

**7. Hash Tables**

• general definitions and implementations
• load factors, efficiency, computational costs
• dealing with collisions – buckets, direct chaining, open addressing
• linear probing, secondary/double hashing
• choosing good hash functions

**8. Graphs**

• general definitions and implementations
• planarity – definitions and theorems
• traversals – depth first and breadth first
• shortest paths – Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s algorithms
• minimal spanning trees – Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm

**9. Problem Solving**
